# bibliotheque_V1
Version 1.0
Web site Django to manage my library with a AirTable database

Objectives are :

to reference the more than 500 books of my library to calculate statistics to know where the books are located

I use AirTable, Python, and a website (Nginx, Django on ovh).

The idea is to learn computer development and perhaps create a game from this work.
